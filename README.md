# HW13

You need my BookStore repository to run this. Run the BookstoreApplication in the package de.unikoeln.se.bookstore.
Afterwards you need to open the cmd to the directory where you've saved my hw13 folder and run the command "ng serve". You need Node.js and Angular CLI(npm install -g @angular/cli) to run the project.
Then you should be able to find the interface under localhost:4200.
